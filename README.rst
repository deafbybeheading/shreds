shreds
------

Shreds is a very basic CD ripper written in bash. It's essentially
just a frontend for `cdparanoia`, `lame`, and the freedb CDDB API.
It has no features to speak of other than being short (<150 lines)
and allowing full control over per-track metadata. And, of course,
being written in bash.
